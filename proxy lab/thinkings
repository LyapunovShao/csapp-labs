   to try to communicate with the tiny server, i copy the csapp code example "echo client" to call the server , 
but both the client and tiny misbehave . inorder to figure out the reason for this ,i think it is important to 
configure a debugging method on CLion for convenience and necessity
   to use csapp.h csapp.c , a special gcc flag "-pthread" should be announced.as a result ,in the cmakelist.txt , i specify
target_link_options(tiny PUBLIC -pthread)
   as the tiny works well in the debug mode , i try to figure out how to write a client being able to successfully
communicate with tiny
   now i implement a proxy.c v0.1 which can send a message to tiny and receive a response from tiny
   it`s time for me to step into the main requirements of the part I
   i submit a version which can get 55/70 from the autograder . the lost 15 scores come from Part III .the drive.sh 
placed a ridiculous request to curl a closed server . some AC solution online even cannot get that 15 scores , i cannot 
figure out why .this lab has to be paused here ,sadly speaking .
